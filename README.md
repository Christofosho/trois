# Trois
A matching game.

## How to play
In the game of Trois, there are many groups of three. There are three different shapes, which come in three different counts, and can have three different fillings, and three different colours. Your goal is to match all but one feature, or to match none of the features, of three cards. Trois is the French word for "three".

1. Draw 12 cards from the deck and place them face up in 3 rows of 4.
2. Look for groups of three cards that have all but one feature matching. Example:

  Card 1: 3 Purple Filled Triangles
  Card 2: 3 Purple Filled Squares
